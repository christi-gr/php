1008136,VM-1054-3,"Table size is very important when deciding which milling machine to buy.  The VM-1054 from Baileigh Industrial has a 10” x 54” table that has been hardened, ground, polished, and coated with a special coating called Turcite® B to extend life and help eliminate corrosion.
The VM-1054 is a variable speed milling machine that is powered by a Yaskawa® inverter.  This inverter is powered by 220 volts of three phase power.  Inverters are great for milling machines because of their ability to be adjusted to any speed desired between 80 and 3800 rpm.  By selecting the right speed tooling life is lengthened and cut quality improves, both of which save money.  Baileigh Industrial selected an NT 40 taper for its spindle to help improve performance as well.  A larger spindle is stronger and has tighter tolerances over a longer period of time.  Rigidity is also very important on a mill that is why Baileigh Industrial went with only the best castings to make the base and frame.  The stronger you make he platform the better the cutting is.
All three axis are powered on the VM-1054 making it easy on the operator.  Another nice feature of the VM-1054 milling machine is the two axis digital readout that comes standard.  This Mitutoyo® digital readout is accurate to 1/10 of 1 thousandth of an inch.  A flood coolant system, air draw bar, and central lubrication system are all factory installed on the VM-1054.
To learn more about the VM-1054 milling machine call a Baileigh Industrial representative."
1008169,VM-1258-3,"When you need a vertical knee mill to do a large job, a small wimpy mill won’t do.  You need to step up to the VM-1258 knee milling machine from Baileigh Industrial.  The VM-1258 vertical mill features a whopping 12” x 58” table, one of the largest you will find on any manual mill.  This large oversized table isn’t just mounted on a wimpy machine either.  The whole machine has been built to reflect the size and weight that this table brings.
In order to build a machine this big, rigidity has to come into the equation.  Baileigh industrial uses only best castings as the starting point for their mills.  The stronger you make he platform the better the cutting is.  From there we selected one of the best spindle packages available, with an NT 40 spindle. A larger spindle is stronger and has tighter tolerances over a longer period of time.  In order to spin a heavy duty spindle like that we decide to go with a Yaskawa® inverter powered by a 5hp 220 volt three phase motor.  The inverter lets the operator chose his RPM from 80 to 3800 rpm.  Being able to choose the correct rpm will make for longer lasting tooling and better cuts.
Movement on the three axis are powered to make it easier to operate.  The X and Y axis also has a Mitutoyo® digital read out as a standard feature.  No need to install it yourself, it is already done at the factory.  The X and Y axis also have square slide ways with covers and ball screws for the best movement available.  A flood coolant system, air draw bar, and central lubrication system are all factory installed on the VM-1258 knee milling machine.

 The VM-942  is a fully variable speed milling machine that allows infinite adjustment to  the speed from 80 to 2700 rpm.  Being  able to fine tune the speed of the quill is important in prolonging tooling  life and saving money.  Speaking of the  quill or spindle Baileigh Industrial has specified a NST-40 spindle taper for  the VM-942.  The larger taper helps  eliminate chatter and run out during the cutting process and make better  cuts.
 The VM-942  has a powerful 3 hp motor that runs on 220 volt single phase power and features  a three axis digital read out.  All three  axis of the VM-942 are powered making this an operators dream.  Other standard features of the Baileigh Industrial vertical mill include a coolant system with catch tray, square slide ways, and a halogen work light.

The MB-350  is made in the USA and is packed with great features.  Operation is controlled by a touch screen  programmer that is capable of having 170 programs with 10 bends per program  with the included memory, but is unlimited with the use of an SD card (standard 2CB SD card, max).  A 10’ mandrel extraction table with rotary  chuck is also included.  This table along  with the four manual carriage stops, allows the operator to “program” where the  next bend is.
This is a  right handed mandrel bender with single stack tooling which makes operation a  lot less confusing for first time operators.   Of course, tooling on the MB-350 like all mandrel benders is application  specific and must be verified to work by Baileigh Industrial.  Tooling consists of five parts|| 1 - Rotary  Bending Die|| 2 - Clamp Die|| 3- Pressure Die|| 4 - Mandrel|| 5 - Wiper Die.

1001883,BSB-127-10/14,"This 10/14 TPI band saw blade is a perfect match for our BS-127P.  This is just one of hundreds of blades that we carry.  If you have a special application, Call us at 1-920-684-4990 and talk to a Baileigh expert.
When you purchase a Baileigh Industrial Band Saw, there are a lot of things to consider. The most important element of a great cut is the blade. When cutting materials other then mild steel other variables come into play.  Below is a brief guide to help you pick out the corect blade.
Picking the right blade:
Cutting mild steel or annealed material you would want no less than 3 teeth touching the material or no more than 24. The ideal amount of teeth touching the material at one time would be 6-12. When picking the correct tooth count you also want to consider the wall thickness too aggressive of a tooth count will case the teeth to get catch in the side walls and you will break your teeth. Too fine of a tooth count will only cause a problem when you are cutting through the top or bottom of your material. This can cause premature blade wear or motor failure.
Conditions that will influence pitch selection:

*Soft materials require less teeth and more gullet capacity.
*Hard materials require more teeth to share in the work and less gullet.
*Machine capabilities. Constant feed machines can use a coarser pitch. Gravity feed machines will require a finer pitch.

Please remember that there are Proper Techniques for All Types of Shapes.Please consult a Baileigh Industrial Technician for help in choosing the correct blade for you application.
DIAGNOSING CUTTING ISSUES WITH BAND SAW BLADES
Premature and Excessive Tooth Wear

*Feed pressure too light, increase it Lower band velocity
*Improper tooth selection, use a finer pitch
*Improper break-in with new band. Velocity and feeding should be reduced the first few cuts
*Teeth are running the wrong direction. Be sure teeth are pointing in proper direction
*Incorrect saw guide insert size for the band, allowing them to strike teeth 

Band Stalls in Work

*Feed pressure too great - decrease feed 
*Teeth too coarse, use finer tooth blade 

Blade Making Belly-Shaped Cuts

*Increase tension 
*Adjust guides closer to work piece 
*Teeth too fine - use a coarse pitch 
*Decrease feed force 
*Teeth dull "

1001915,BSB-250/260-4/6,"This 4/6 TPI band saw blade is a perfect match for our BS-250/260 Series.  This is just one of hundreds of blades that we carry.  If you have a special application, Call us at 1-920-684-4990 and talk to a Baileigh expert.
When you purchase a Baileigh Industrial Band Saw, there are a lot of things to consider. The most important element of a great cut is the blade. When cutting materials other then mild steel other variables come into play.  Below is a brief guide to help you pick out the corect blade.
Picking the right blade:
Cutting mild steel or annealed material you would want no less than 3 teeth touching the material or no more than 24. The ideal amount of teeth touching the material at one time would be 6-12. When picking the correct tooth count you also want to consider the wall thickness too aggressive of a tooth count will case the teeth to get catch in the side walls and you will break your teeth. Too fine of a tooth count will only cause a problem when you are cutting through the top or bottom of your material. This can cause premature blade wear or motor failure.
Conditions that will influence pitch selection:

*Soft materials require less teeth and more gullet capacity.
*Hard materials require more teeth to share in the work and less gullet.
*Machine capabilities. Constant feed machines can use a coarser pitch. Gravity feed machines will require a finer pitch.

Please remember that there are Proper Techniques for All Types of Shapes.Please consult a Baileigh Industrial Technician for help in choosing the correct blade for you application.

When you purchase a Baileigh Industrial Cold Saw, there are a lot of things to consider. The most important element of a great cut is the blade. When cutting materials other then mild steel other variables come into play. 
Mild SteelOptimal cut quality and blade life is achieved by cutting at a speed of approximately 100 to 125 SFM (surface feet per minute)
Stainless Steel
The person selecting the blade must multiply the tooth count in the above chart by 1.2 to ensure proper blade life and cut quality. Optimal cut quality and blade life is achieved by cutting at a speed of approximately 70 SFM (surface feet per minute)
AluminumThe person selecting the blade must multiply the tooth count in the above chart by .75 to ensure proper blade life and cut quality. Optimal cut quality and blade life is achieved by cutting at a speed of approximately 300 SFM (surface feet per minute)
Solids Solids also have there quirks when it comes to cut quality and blade life. Below is a chart to help you pick the best blade for your solid application. Remember that the same rules for blade speed apply to solids as they do to tube and pipe.
One other important idea to consider when trying to optimize blade life is the type of cold saw you are purchasing. A semi-automatic cold saw with controlled decent of the head will always provide longer blade life over a manually operated saw.
If you have any further questions regarding blades for your cold saw, please contact any of our service technicians at 920-684-4990. They will be more than willing to help you chose the right blade from the hundreds that we have in stock and ready to ship."

This is just one of hundreds of blades that we carry.  If you have a special application, Call us at 1-920-684-4990 and talk to a Baileigh expert.
When you purchase a Baileigh Industrial Cold Saw, there are a lot of things to consider. The most important element of a great cut is the blade. When cutting materials other then mild steel other variables come into play. 
Mild SteelOptimal cut quality and blade life is achieved by cutting at a speed of approximately 100 to 125 SFM (surface feet per minute)Stainless Steel
The person selecting the blade must multiply the tooth count in the above chart by 1.2 to ensure proper blade life and cut quality. Optimal cut quality and blade life is achieved by cutting at a speed of approximately 70 SFM (surface feet per minute)
AluminumThe person selecting the blade must multiply the tooth count in the above chart by .75 to ensure proper blade life and cut quality. Optimal cut quality and blade life is achieved by cutting at a speed of approximately 300 SFM (surface feet per minute)
Solids Solids also have there quirks when it comes to cut quality and blade life. Below is a chart to help you pick the best blade for your solid application. Remember that the same rules for blade speed apply to solids as they do to tube and pipe.
One other important idea to consider when trying to optimize blade life is the type of cold saw you are purchasing. A semi-automatic cold saw with controlled decent of the head will always provide longer blade life over a manually operated saw.
If you have any further questions regarding blades for your cold saw, please contact any of our service technicians at 920-684-4990. They will be more then willing to help you chose the right blade from the hundreds that we have in stock and ready to ship."

1015098,BSB-127P-8/12,"This 8/12 TPI band saw blade is a perfect match for our BS-127P.  This is just one of hundreds of blades that we carry.  If you have a special application, Call us at 1-920-684-4990 and talk to a Baileigh expert.
When you purchase a Baileigh Industrial Band Saw, there are a lot of things to consider. The most important element of a great cut is the blade. When cutting materials other then mild steel other variables come into play.  Below is a brief guide to help you pick out the corect blade.
Picking the right blade:
Cutting mild steel or annealed material you would want no less than 3 teeth touching the material or no more than 24. The ideal amount of teeth touching the material at one time would be 6-12. When picking the correct tooth count you also want to consider the wall thickness too aggressive of a tooth count will case the teeth to get catch in the side walls and you will break your teeth. Too fine of a tooth count will only cause a problem when you are cutting through the top or bottom of your material. This can cause premature blade wear or motor failure.
Conditions that will influence pitch selection:

*Soft materials require less teeth and more gullet capacity.
*Hard materials require more teeth to share in the work and less gullet.
*Machine capabilities. Constant feed machines can use a coarser pitch. Gravity feed machines will require a finer pitch.

Please remember that there are Proper Techniques for All Types of Shapes.Please consult a Baileigh Industrial Technician for help in choosing the correct blade for you application.
DIAGNOSING CUTTING ISSUES WITH BAND SAW BLADES
Premature and Excessive Tooth Wear

*Feed pressure too light, increase it Lower band velocity
*Improper tooth selection, use a finer pitch
*Improper break-in with new band. Velocity and feeding should be reduced the first few cuts
*Teeth are running the wrong direction. Be sure teeth are pointing in proper direction
*Incorrect saw guide insert size for the band, allowing them to strike teeth 

Band Stalls in Work

*Feed pressure too great - decrease feed 
*Teeth too coarse, use finer tooth blade 

Blade Making Belly-Shaped Cuts

*Increase tension 
*Adjust guides closer to work piece 
*Teeth too fine - use a coarse pitch 
*Decrease feed force 
*Teeth dull "

The Thermal Dynamics® CUTMASTER® 52 plasma cutter is one of the most powerful 1/2” (12mm) plasma cutters, with a full 60 amps of cutting power. The CUTMASTER® TRUE™ Series plasma cutters are the only systems that offer the precision of the TRUE™ Cut Drag Tip Series ™. The 60 Amp tip allows the system to drag cut up to ¼” (6mm) with ease. Giving the absolute best cut quality possible. The CUTMASTER® 52 combines power with the well know performance and features of the industry-leading 1Torch®.Features

*Increased cut capacity and cut speed – Cutmaster 60i’s recommended cut capacity is 3/8 inch with a maximum sever of 1 1/2 inches and a 3/8-inch pierce.
*Superior duty cycle – Cut more, faster, longer. The machine’s duty cycle of 50% at 60 A while cutting half-inch mild steel equates to a 7.6 kW power supply rating – the highest output in its class.
*Rugged roll cage – With multiple lift points, the sturdy four-handle roll cage makes it easy to transport your Cutmaster 60i where you need to – including outdoors. The machine’s IP23S protection rating proves it’s hardy enough to face whatever elements come your way.
*Automatic multi-voltage detection – The system senses what type of power you’re hooked up to and adjusts accordingly so you don’t waste any timemanually tweaking your settings.
*Power factor correction (PFC) – If you find yourself with a poor connection via generator or otherwise, PFC will stop the draw from spiking and keep power flowing smoothly.
*Long arc stretch – When you’re in an odd position or trying to hit a corner, Cutmaster 60i’s extra-long arc will stretch to keep constant contact with the workpiece.
*Only three consumable parts – That means fewer parts to keep on hand and quicker changes, so you can keep burning and earning
*Consumables end-of-life indicator – Cutmaster 60i’s end-of-life indicator monitors the remaining life of the consumable parts and alerts you when it’s time to replace, maintaining optimal performance and cut quality.
*Consumables configuration guide – Look to the top of the power source for easy-to-follow instructions on how the consumables work together. Need more info  There’s a quick-start guide in the box that’ll have you up and running in no time.
*Modes of operation – The machine also has four modes of operation – twice as many as competitors – cut mode, expanded metal cutting mode, gouging mode, and latch mode, which allows you to lock in so you can focus on what’s important: cutting. 
*Durable LED display – The system’s large, high-visibility display allows for easy viewing of all machine settings from a distance. The intuitive, easy-to-use display instantly provides the necessary feedback for keeping your settings and cut quality optimized.
*SL60QD 1Torch – This torch has a lot going for it. First, it’s compatible with the entire Cutmaster family and other outfits in the industry. Second, “QD” stands for quick disconnect, which gives you the option of replacing only what you need to replace – the torch or the lead – and that saves you money in the long run.

 

*Comes complete with: 
*Power Supply 
*1Torch with ATC Quick Disconnect and Lead 
*Spare Parts Kit 
*Input Power Cable
